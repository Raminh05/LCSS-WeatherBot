# London-Ontario-Discord-WeatherBot
It's a weather bot, that runs in a Discord server! Gathers data from Environment Canada.

Planned Features:
- ~~Status (rich presence) for the bot (it will show: "playing with the weather")~~ (Done)
- ~~Auto update a certain channel title (maybe a vc or text) in the discord server to display temperature data (e.g. "Temperature: 8 degrees")~~ (Done as of 03.12.2021)
- Auto-update data every 1hr 30minutes. Maybe a while loop with time.sleep()? (I suck)
- ~~For weather data sent to text from bot commands, a proper graphical interface to display data is "planned" (embeds)~~ (Done as of 03.12.2021)
- Conditional weather icons (time and weather condition). For example, a clear weather icon that can either have a moon or sun depending on time of day. (WIP)
