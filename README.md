# London-Ontario-Discord-WeatherBot
It's a weather bot, that runs in a Discord server! Gathers data from Environment Data.

Planned Features:
- Status (rich presence) for the bot (it will show: "Making Meatballs")
- Auto update a certain channel title (maybe a vc or text) in the discord server to display temperature data (e.g. "Temperature: 8 degrees")
- For weather data sent to text from bot commands, a proper graphical interface to display data is "planned"
